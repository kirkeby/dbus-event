dbus-events
===========

Python daemon for handling DBus signals.

Requirements
------------

You'll need the daemon Python package (as well as python-dbus of course.)

Usage
-----

Place signal callbacks in Python modules named <source>/<signal>/<callback>.py,
where <source> and <signal> specify the DBus source and signal to connect to,
and <callback> is any filename describing the intent of each callback.  Inside
each module should be a function name callback, which will be called each time
the signal is raised.

For example the callback from org.gnome.ScreenSaver/ActiveChanged/mytunes.py
pauses mytunes playback when the Gnome screensaver is activated.
